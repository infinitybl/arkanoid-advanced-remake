# arkanoid-advanced-remake

This is a remake of 5 levels from the Arkanoid Advance GBA game created using Java with the Java Swing library for the user interface. 
I implemented all of the 7 powerups from the original game, added keyboard and mouse controls, and put in high scores as well. 
You can check it out in the YouTube video below.

NOTE: I removed all asset files such as backgrounds, music and sprites using a .gitignore due to copyright
